# LeanStorage Overview

Thank you for choosing LeanCloud. We offer a collection of SDKs that help you build and publish an entire website or application without implementing the backend by yourself.

## The Problem We're Solving

Most Internet-based applications are data-driven and share a very similar architecture:

- The frontend presents the UI with data and handles interactions with the user, while exchanging data with the app server on the backend.
- The app server handles the main logic of the application by either generating data and storing it to the data server or gathering data from the data server and sending it to the frontend.
- The data server stores the data and makes backups of it.

The model mentioned above works for most of the applications we see today. Although these applications share a variety of data structures and logic, they all have data flowing behind the scenes which drives their functions. They also share a very similar backend framework (like LAMP). However, the same system has been built again and again by developers, which tremendously increased the time and cost needed before an application can be launched.

## Our Solution

LeanCloud combines the most commonly used backend functions into a BaaS (Backend as a Service) consisting of the following parts:

1. **Object-Oriented Data Storage**<br>The data transmitted between the frontend and the backend can be abstracted into objects regardless of the size or meaning of it. With LeanCloud, you can store any types of objects and freely create, read, update, or delete them. The scaling of the database is automatically handled by us so you don't have to worry about the size of your data or the amount of traffic produced by your application.

2. **Large File Distribution**<br>No matter if you are building a website, an application, or a game, you definitely have a number of static files that you need to store and distribute. Comparing to the data generated by your application, these files bear larger sizes and often rely on [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) for faster delivery. LeanCloud provides a full support for the storage and distribution of such files.

3. **LeanEngine for Custom Server-Side Logic**<br>If the existing API cannot fulfill your requirements, you can define your own server-side logic with LeanEngine. Similar to [Google App Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine), LeanEngine allows you to build custom logic for your application with few lines of code. The code will be deployed to the cloud and works together with other services provided by LeanCloud.

4. **Offline Data Analysis (for Business and Enterprise Plans)**<br>After launching your application for a while, you may want to look into the data generated by your users and see if any patterns can be found. With our offline data analysis platform, you can quickly process and analyse the data behind your application. The platform is totally distributed and reactive with its efficiency way higher than [Hadoop MapReduce](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html).

Below you will learn about the core concepts used by our storage system.

## AVObject

As mentioned earlier, the data transmitted between clients and servers are abstracted into objects. An object stored on LeanCloud is called an "AVObject". Each AVObject has a class name and holds data in key-value pairs that are JSON-compatible. LeanCloud doesn't limit the number of keys allowed in each AVObject, nor does it require each AVObject to contain all the keys defined. To illustrate, imagine that we have a game that needs to store the following types of data:

- User-related data, including usernames, passwords, and genders.
- Score-related data, including players, scores, modes, and scenes.

We can store all these data with a single type of AVObject (suppose the class name to be `AllInOne`):

```
// User-related data
{ "username": "steve", "password": "xxxxxx", "gender": "Male" }
// Score-related data
{ "playerName": "steve", "score": 1337, "cheatMode": false, "scene": 4 }
```

It's allowed that you store these two pieces of information with the same type of AVObject. However, we **strongly recommend that you assign AVObjects with different purposes to different classes**. For the example above, we can have a `User` class for all user-related data and a `GameScore` class for all score-related data.

AVObjects are categorized into tables according to their types (we use "table" here to help you better understand the concept; AVObjects are actually categorized based on the classes they fall into). AVObjects with the same class can be found in the same table. Each time when an AVObjects is saved to the cloud, a unique `objectId` will be assigned to it which is comparable to the primary key of a relational database. `createdAt` and `updatedAt` will also be filled in by the cloud which indicate the time the object is created and updated.

There are some differences between LeanCloud and traditional relational databases:

- LeanCloud doesn't require interfaces like JDBC or ODBC for building connections. Instead, it directly exchanges JSON objects with clients via HTTP. By doing so, clients can access the data stored in the cloud without any additional backend servers. We offer native SDKs for multiple platforms (iOS, Android, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Java, Windows Phone, .Net, Unity3D, C++, and other ones made by our community) that help you easily use our services with the language you are familiar with. We also offer REST API for you to use directly.
- LeanCloud accepts all kinds of objects that are JSON-compatible. You can add new keys to a class whenever you want without defining table structures in advance.
- LeanCloud adopts a new way to build relationships between AVObjects that doesn't involve primary keys or foreign keys. There is also no joining tables when performing queries. See [Data Relationships](#data-relationships) for more details.
- LeanCloud adopts a way that's different from SQL for querying AVObjects. See [AVQuery](#avquery) for more details.

### Data Types Supported

The **keys** in an AVObject can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. A custom key cannot start with `__` (double underscores). The **values** in an AVObject can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or dictionaries. LeanCloud stores data in the format of JSON, so any objects that can be converted into JSON can be stored on LeanCloud. Beside the basic types, LeanCloud can also handle dates, `Bytes`, and files. To summarize, the types allowed in an AVObject include:

- `String`
- `Number`
- `Boolean`
- `Array`
- `Object`
- `Date`
- `Bytes` (base64-encoded binary data)
- `File`
- `Null`

An `Object` can contain key-value pairs with each value to be a JSON-compatible object. Keep in mind that the key of an `Object` cannot be `__type` or contain `$` or `.` since they are reserved for special purposes. `ACL`, `className`, `createdAt`, `objectId`, and `updatedAt` are also reserved fields and cannot be used as custom **keys**.

Our SDKs can handle certain conversions between native types (for Objective-C and Java) and JSON. For example, when you are saving an `NSString`, it will be automatically converted to a `String`.

There are two ways to store binary data. When storing small pieces of data, you can use `Bytes` which allows you to directly write `NSData` or `bytes[]` into an AVObject. When storing actual files (like images, videos, and documents), you can store them as AVFiles with `File` and link them to existing AVObjects.

### Data Type Solidification

When a class is first created, it does not contain a predefined schema. Therefore, for the first object being saved with it, the fields of it can hold any types of values that are supported.

However, when a field is saved for at least one time, the type of data it can accept will be restricted to those saved in the past. For example, if a `User` object is saved with its `name` to be a `String`, then all the `User` objects saved after that must have their `name` to be `String` (an error will be returned by SDK if you attempt to save other types of data).

One exception is that all the fields can accept `null` regardless of their types.

### Data Management

You can manage the data in your application by going to [Dashboard > LeanStorage > Data](/data.html?appid={{appid}}#/) in your browser. This web console shows all the objects stored in your application in JSON.

Keep in mind that:

- Entering `null` as a value will set the value to be the empty value `null` rather than the string `"null"`.
- `objectId`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` are set by the system automatically and cannot be edited.
- Classes starting with an underscore are the built-in classes that cannot be deleted. You are not supposed to edit the default fields in them, but you can always add new fields.

## Data Relationships

As mentioned earlier, LeanCloud doesn't use primary keys or foreign keys to build relationships between AVObjects. The following entities are used instead:

- **Pointer**<br>You can store the pointer to an object as a property of another project. This is often used for one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.
- **Array**<br>You can store an array of pointers as a property of another project. This is often used for one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
- **Associative table**<br>You can create a class that links objects from other classes and attach additional information for each relationship. For example, when building a social network, you can have two fields of this class for followers and followees, and have a third field for the times the relationships are formed.

See [Data Modeling](relation-guide.html) for more instructions.

## AVQuery

Since LeanCloud adopts a data model that's different from those of relational databases, AVQuery is used in place of SQL for querying data. With AVQuery, you can:

- Query a single object or multiple objects;
- Apply constraints to queries;
- Implement pagination;
- Perform inner queries;
- Cache query results so that history data is available even there's no Internet connectivity.

## AVFile

Beside basic types of data, files like images, videos, and documents, as well as binary data, can also be stored on LeanCloud. Since data larger than **128 KB** cannot be written into an AVObject, AVFile becomes a better carrier for it. AVFile also works with CDN so that they can be delivered faster to the users. You can access AVFiles with either a shared domain or your own domains (recommended). Both HTTP and HTTPS are supported.

## AVUser

Almost all the apps need a user system to store information related to users. With AVUser, you can easily implement functions like signing up with email, signing up with phone number, and logging in with phone verification code.

A user can sign up or log in with the following methods:

- Username (alphanumeric) + password
- Email + password
- Phone number + password
- Phone number + verification code (if already signed up, then log in; if not, create a new account and log in)
- OAuth (Facebook, Google, etc.)

A user can also reset password with email or phone number. See guides of each SDK for more details.
