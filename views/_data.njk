{% macro file_url_query() %}
Note that the `url` field of internal files (files uploaded to LeanCloud file service) is dynamically generated by the cloud, which will switch custom domain names automatically.
Therefore, querying files by the `url` field is only applicable to external files (files created by saving the external URL directly to the `_File` table).
Query internal files by the `key` field (path in URL) instead.
