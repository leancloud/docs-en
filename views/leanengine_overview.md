# LeanEngine Overview

LeanEngine is a hosting platform that lets you run server-side programs written in the language of your choice (Node.js, Python, etc.). Simply deploy the server-side logics to the cloud (websites or cloud functions) and LeanEngine will handle load balancing and rolling deployment for you.
