# SDK Setup Guide

## Client-side SDKs

Client-side SDKs are for Web and mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) and support backendless application architecture.

- [JavaScript](sdk_setup-js.html)
- [Objective-C](sdk_setup-objc.html)
- [Swift](sdk_setup-swift.html)
- [Android/Java](sdk_setup-java.html)
- [Flutter](sdk_setup-flutter.html)
- [.Net](sdk_setup-dotnet.html)

## Server-side SDKs

Server-side SDKs are primarily used in trusted server environments like [LeanEngine](leanengine_overview.html), to invoke management APIs and [cloud functions](leanengine_cloudfunction_guide-node.html).

The best way to develop with an SDK on LeanEngine is starting from a template project: [LeanEngine Quickstart](leanengine_quickstart.html).
The template project already includes the project skeleton and the SDK initialization code, so you can get right to application functionalitie immediately.

If you need to use these SDKs on your server, please refer to the following documentation to install and configure them.
